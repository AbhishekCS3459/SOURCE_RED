# SourceRED -  A platform to trust for your open source projects.

Our DAO project solves the lack of transparent governance and funding in open source projects. Aimed at creating a decentralized system, our objectives include enhancing decision-making, ensuring fair rewards, and increasing collaboration. As newcomers to Web3, we faced challenges in blockchain integration and GitHub API issues, but overcame them through learning and problem-solving. Our DAO fosters a more equitable environment for developers. Use our DAO for transparent governance, fair rewards, and boosted engagement in the open source community
